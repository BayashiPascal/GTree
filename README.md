# GTree
GTree is a C library providing structures and functions to manipulate tree structures.

A GTree is a structure containing a pointer toward its parent, a void* pointer toward user's data and a GSet of subtrees. The GTree offers the same interface has a GSet to manipulate its subtrees. It also provides a function to cut the GTree from its parent.

The library provides also three iterators to run through the trees: GTreeIterDepth, GTreeIterBreadth, GTreeIterValue which step, respectively, in depth first order, breadth first order and value (sorting value of the GSet of subtrees) first order.

## How to install this repository
1) Create a directory which will contains this repository and all the repositories it is depending on. Lets call it "Repos"
2) Download the master branch of this repository into "Repos". Unzip it if necessary.
3) The folder's name for the repository should be followed by "-master", rename the folder by removing "-master".
4) cd to the repository's folder
5) If wget is not installed: ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wget``` on Ubuntu 16.04, or ```brew install wget``` on Mac OSx
6) If gawk is not installed: ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gawk```  on Ubuntu 16.04, ```brew install gawk``` on Mac OSx
7) If this repository is the first one you are installing in "Repos", run the command ```make -k pbmake_wget```
8) Run the command ```make``` to compile the repository. 
9) Eventually, run the command ```main``` to run the unit tests and check everything is ok.
10) Refer to the documentation to learn how to use this repository.

The dependancies to other repositories should be resolved automatically and needed repositories should be installed in the "Repos" folder. However this process is not completely functional and some repositories may need to be installed manually. In this case, you will see a message from the compiler saying it cannot find some headers. Then install the missing repository with the following command, e.g. if "pbmath.h" is missing: ```make pbmath_wget```. The repositories should compile fine on Ubuntu 16.04. On Mac OSx, there is currently a problem with the linker.
